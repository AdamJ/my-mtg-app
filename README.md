# MTG Life Counter

A Magic: The Gathering Life Counter and deck list app.

## What is this?

Basically, this is a life counter and deck list "app" that I use for when I play at Cube events. All of the other counters and/or deck builders that I've used are great in their own ways, but I wanted to make something for myself that I could customize. If others like it, maybe I'll share it or distribute it through one of the app stores.
